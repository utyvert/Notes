# Git & Github

- Git is a free open-source distributed verison control system.
- Store files over a period of time (snapshots).
  - Revert to a safe and old version should things fail.
  - Back ups with tracking of who did what, when, etc.
- Git has integrity.
  - Everything is check summed and every change is detected before storage.
  - Very hard to accidentally delete data.
