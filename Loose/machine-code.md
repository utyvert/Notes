# Machine Code

- Machine code is the elemental language of computers.
- It is read by the CPU - and is composed of digital binary numbers (1s and 0s).
- It is designed to run as fast as possible - considered the lowest level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program.
- It is possible to write programs in machine code - but it is tedious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constants manually.


## Binary

- Binary is a numbering scheme with only two possible values for each digit - 0 or 1. This is the basis for all binary code used in computing system, at a very base level (low level).
- Inside these systems, a binary number consists of a series of eight bits. This series is known as a byte.
- The position of each digit determines its decimal value. By understanding the position of each bit, a binary number can be converted into a decimal number.
