# Stacks

**Functions Used:** Push, pop, peek, length.

An array can be used to create a stack in Javascript.

```
var letters = []; // this is our stack
```

A stack is like a stack of books - the last book you put on top of the stack will be the first book you take off of the stack - Last In, First Out.

# Sets

ES6 has a built in set object - does not contain all of the methods that are common to sets (you may have to implement part of the set yourself).

The set data structure is like an array - except there are *no duplicate items* - they are in no particular order. The typical use of a set is to check for the presence of an item.

# Queues

The queue data structure is similar to a stack - but instead of Last In, First Out, it is First In, First Out. It is much like a queue at the supermarket.

## Priority Queue

In a priority queue, you pass in an element AND its priority. If all the priorities are the same number, the queue behaves like a normal queue. If there are different priorities, then they are passed in by priority.
